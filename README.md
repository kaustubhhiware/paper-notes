# paper-notes
A public amalgamation of papers I've come through and managed to read. This involves papers I've come through because of my B.Tech Project, or curriculum or otherwise. This space to be heavily updated.

# What I'm trying to do:

Describe the papers I've read / want to read, to create smaller summaries and blog (yet to be online) about them, so that other people have to spend fewer time on them. Expect this space to be fully complete by 7th October 2017.

## _But why though_

Because everyone who maintains something in their mind, which they would not want to compromise with. I'd be surprised if someone outside a group of people actually find this useful.

# Contribute

Really? If you do really want to contribute, please add a paper
- under the appropriate category
- add a brief write-up which could help the reader get a basic idea what the paper is about
- accompanied with a more-detailed blog/writeup you might have come across elsewhere(not necessary).

Sample paper:
```
- [x] [Paper name](Paper link)
    Small writeup describing the paper
    Blog/Writeup link (Not necessary)
```

# Natural Language Processing

- [x] [All that is English may be Hindi: Enhancing language identification through automatic ranking of likeliness of word borrowing in social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08446)

 The paper tries to identify code-mixing and code-borrowing patterns via Online Social Media, namely Twitter.
